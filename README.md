The <b>Data Security and Protection Toolkit</b> is an online self-assessment tool that allows organisations to measure their performance against the National Data Guardianâ€™s 10 data security standards.

All organisations that have access to NHS patient data and systems must use this toolkit to provide assurance that they are practising good data security and that personal information is handled correctly. This includes trusts, commissioners and CSUs.

The data displayed in this page will show all organisations open as of 16th of November 2023. Any organisations which have merged and do not have a DSPT status will inherit the DSPT status of the merged organisation. Any organisations which have failed to submit a 22/23 DSPT Status will be considered as 'Not Published'.

The following information displays data taken from a specific snapshot of the DSPT data. The latest status information was downloaded on <b>16th November 2023</b>.

You can find the previous iteration of this page showing the 21/22 DSPT data at <a href="https://nhsx.github.io/open-cyber/21_22">21/22 Open Cyber Page</a>

For more information on the Data Security and Protection Toolkit, please visit the <a href="https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/">DSPT portal</a>.
