The <b>Data Security and Protection Toolkit</b> is an online self-assessment tool that allows organisations to measure their performance against the National Data Guardianâ€™s 10 data security standards.

All organisations that have access to NHS patient data and systems must use this toolkit to provide assurance that they are practising good data security and that personal information is handled correctly. This includes trusts, commissioners and CSUs.

The following information displays data taken from a specific snapshot of the DSPT data. The latest status information was downloaded on the <b>8th February 2022</b>.

For more information on the Data Security and Protection Toolkit, please visit the <a href="https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/">DSPT portal</a>.

## Notes on Methodology

<b>Composite Metrics for ICS</b>

The DSPT status for Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) and Trusts are coded (scored) as follows to create the proxy for Integrated Care System (ICS) summary metrics:

<li>Status Exceeded = 3</li>
<li>Status Met = 1</li>
<li>Approaching Standards = -1</li>
<li>Not Published/Not Met = -3</li>
<br>
CCG scores within an ICS are then weighted based on the resident population.

Trust scores within an ICS are weighted either a) as simple average or b) based on their EPRR score.

Finally, for each ICS, the CCG and Trust scores are weighted equally to arrive at the ICS composite score.

The final scaling for each of the summary metrics displayed will have an upper bound of 3 and a lower bound of -3.

<!---
<b>Emergency Preparedness, Resilience and Response (EPRR) Score</b>

Organisations are ranked in a 4 tier system, to measure their impact of risk. This is used to calculate one of our summary metrics below. The Tier ranks are mapped as follows:

<li>Tier 1 - Major Trauma Centres/ Ambulance Trusts/ NHS Blood & Transplant = 4</li>
<li>Tier 2 - Trauma Units/ Specialist Hospitals = 3</li>
<li>Tier 3 - Geographically remote / High secure Mental Health = 2</li>
<li>Tier 4 - Community Hospitals = 1</li>
<br>
<b>Successor Organisations</b>
<br>
Organisations open 31st March 2021 are considered (the end of 20/21, the financial year of the last DSPT edition that closed).

Organisations without a published DSPT status as a result of a merger, inherit their DSPT status from it's successor organisation if published. Otherwise, the DSPT status will be mapped as 'Not Published'.

## CCGs and Proportions of Trusts Compliance - Pie Charts Diameter by Population
<br>
The proportions of trust compliance within each ICS with boundaries (in black) are shown. The diameter of each pie chart relates to the population level within each ICS.

The proportions of trust compliance within each ICS with boundaries (in black) are shown. The ICSs are colored to represent the patient population level. The darker the shade of blue the higher the patient population level.
